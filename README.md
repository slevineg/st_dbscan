# ST-DBSCAN (forked)

**Simple and effective method for spatial-temporal clustering**

*st_dbscan* is an open-source software package for the spatial-temporal clustering of movement data:

- Implemnted using `numpy` and `sklearn`
- Scales to memory - using chuncking see `st_dbscan.fit_frame_split`

## Installation
The easiest way to install *st_dbscan* is by using `pip` :

    pip install st-dbscan

## How to use

```python
from st_dbscan import ST_DBSCAN

st_dbscan = ST_DBSCAN(eps1 = 0.05, eps2 = 10, min_samples = 5)
st_dbscan.fit(data)

```
